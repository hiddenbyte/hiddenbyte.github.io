The arrow of time moves forward, yet nostalgia pulls us backward, creating resistance to the present and future. Thus, nostalgia is a feeling that is not in harmony with the natural flow of time.</p><p>This does not mean we should forget the past or any feelings, whether bad or good. But we should not become attached to the past—being attached to the past is what nostalgia is—and we should let go of the past.</p><p>Nostalgia makes us stuck, closed off to new experiences or new ways of experiencing things, and it diminishes our creativity and innovation.</p></main></main><footer>Written by <a href=/pages/about>mehul</a></footer></body></html>
