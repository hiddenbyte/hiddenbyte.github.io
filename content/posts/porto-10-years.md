This month marks 10 years since I moved to Porto, and I can say that this city feels like home. 

This doesnâ€™t mean I feel like a *Tripeiro*, nor do I feel like an *Alfacinha* (for those who know me, I was born and raised in Lisbon). Fuck, sometimes I donâ€™t even feel like a Portuguese. But I definitely feel that I am at the right place ðŸ’™
